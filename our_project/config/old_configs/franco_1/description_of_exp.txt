Exp 1

Run one digit addition to see where the errors lie

Exp 2

Increment learning rate from 0.001 to 0.01 to see if we can surpass 0.9

Exp 3

Use SGD instead of adam (after manually setting LR=16) to get to 0.98 acc

Exp 4

Come back to adam to see if larger learning rate is better. It is not. (1 doesn't work)
